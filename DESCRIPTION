Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors: Gil Kanfer and Heather Buldwin
Description: This project permits the development and utilization of a pooled optical screen by making use of photoactivation and sorting. AI-PS algorithms provide a structure for segmenting cells, training machine learning algorithms to categorize cellular phenotypes, and applying these for executing a screen on the fly. To learn more, take a look at Kanfer et al., 2021.
